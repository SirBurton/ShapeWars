# ShapeWars
A simple trading base game patterned after one from the TI calculators

This game was created to help students learning to program.  The source code is intended to be straight-forward, not necessarily effecient.  
Feel free to look at the code, make modifications, have fun.
If you make a fun improvement, I might add it to the game.
